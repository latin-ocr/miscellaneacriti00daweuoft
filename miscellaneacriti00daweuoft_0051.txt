powers ημ and ειμι, did not take place, till the cha-
racter H was introduced. But, according to my
explication, we have in this inscription the power ημι

in the *form εμι. So that your notion of archaism 329
and mine of dialects are not found to coincide.

I am preparing for the press a volume in 'the
critical way, (which I shall desire the favour of you
to revise,) with the following inscription: Emenda-
tiones in Poetas Graecos, Aristophanem„Euripidem,
Sophoclem, AEschylum, Callimachum, Theocritum,
Pindarum, Hesiodum, Homerum. Praemittitur dis-
sertatio de praecipuis Poetarum dramaticorum metris,
uti et de Accentibus cum ψευδωνυμοις tum veris.
Hanc excipiunt animadversiones in Cl. Bentleii
Emendationes in duas priores Aristophanis FabulaS.
In Praefatione autem disseritur de aspiratione V au
prout in sermone Homerico obtinebat. Agmen ex·
tremum claudunt alterae Animadversioncs in Phile-
leutheri Lipsiensis sive Bentleii Emendationes in
Menandri et Philemonis Reliquias. I have a pretty
large apparatus, out of which these emendations will
be selected3 upon Aristophanes in particular about
1500. For one of these 1 am in a great measure
obliged to a conjecture of yours‚ Lect. Lys. p. 686.
For the nonsensical αναπολεισθαι you write απολι-
σθαινει. But we have by this means a Dactyl in the
beginning of a Trochaic verse, contrary to the laws
of that metre. By the way, the true writing of the

verb you have offered* is απολισθανει. Ι read αν 330
απολισθοι. This reading you will find preferable to

your conjecture, even in point of diction. I need
not mention its conformity to the laws of Trochaic
