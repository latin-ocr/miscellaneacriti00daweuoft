of us these declare, I need not mention. And here
be pleased to consider, whether it would not have
been an extravagant wantonness to intend, that the
latter E in ΣΙΓΕΙΕΣ should be pronounced ΕΙ, when
this very power isin the preceding syllable expressed
in full. You meet with nothing similar in the use
of O.

Another authority referred to in your Commen-
tary is the Delian Inscription. To this Ι objected,
that the inscription was AEolic, and that, therefore,

would be enough for my purpose. But further, the
digamma F, which appears in the inscription, is
a strong argument for its being AEolic: for that the

probable, from the' epithet constantly given it. The
inscription has still. further marks of AEolism: for·if
it was not AEolic, there is no doubt to be made, but
that we should have there had Tor AFTOF Amor, not
TO AFTO AIOO: for why should the power of the
aspiration Waw, be left to be thrice understood, when
’tis plain, that a character expressive of it was ready
at hand? The reason of our meeting with such in-
