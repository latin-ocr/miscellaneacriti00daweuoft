APPENDIX. 1 7 *·

other copy of the inscription exhibits ΜΕΛΕΔΑΙΝΕΝ
without any such interstice as appears in Shuckford's,
I shall oppose the one to 'the other, that so the
authority of both may be destroyed. As to the other
word EIIQE12EN, which you say shews, that E and
EI were convertible3 all that 1 can gather from
thence is, that E and I were capable of being by
inaccuracy transposed, that is, that ΕΠΟΕΙΣΕΝ might

the inscription can be justly allowed to have any·
weight in the present controversy, except the two

words HPYTANEION and EII'EIEE: and for whether
