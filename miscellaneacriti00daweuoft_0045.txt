of AthenaeUS: Παντες οἱ αρχαιοι τῳ ΟΥ αντ-ι του Ο
στοιχειου προσεχρωντο, παραπλησιως και τῲ ΕΙ αντι του
Ε. These words you say are interpreted by the
criticS, as if the author had said, “ The Ancients
used ΟΥ and O, El and E promiscuously.” The
critics must excuse me, if Ι cannot concur with them
in beingso liberal to Athaeneus, as to bestow, upon
this passage just twice as much meaning ²¹* as it ever 322
had in it. He tells us only, that the Ancients used
ΟΥ instead of O, and EI instead of E: but as to¹ the
converse he is entirely silent. This observation of
Athenaeus, I presume, relates to such words as νουσος
and Ξεινος, instead of νοσος and ξενος. lf this be the
case, it either does not affect the present controversy,
or makes against your hypothesis. Ι could wish you
had referred me to the page, where it occurs in Ca-
saubon’s edition. But you have contrived a method
by transposing the author's words to make him
affirm the converse of what has hitherto been his
constant doctrine. But the ancient system of gram-
mar, you say, requires this transposition. lt indeed

allows of it, as far as O and OW are concerned 3 but
this, with submissim, is all that it does.

Your next quotation is from Plato: Οἱ αρχαιο-
τατοι ine-pau την ἦμεραν, εκαλουν οἱ δε ἑμεραν. You
are welcome to add, if you please, οὶ δε ετι και
εἱμεραν, for‘even so the passage will have no relation
to any thing, which 1 maintain. It does not at all
concern my cause, in how many different manners
soever any word was at different times or at the same
time written. All that I contend for is, that the
same Greeks, who wrote E, never pronounced it EI,
any otherwise than as A was pronounced ΑΛΦΑ, *that 32 3
