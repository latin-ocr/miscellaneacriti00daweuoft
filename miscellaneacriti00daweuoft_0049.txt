APPENDIX. 19*

stances as ΔΙΟΝΥΣΟ is, that in other parts of Greece

there was no capital character ²¹* denotingthe aspira· 327

tion Waw. This, as well as the other aspiration He,
was lest to be supplied by the common norma ‚lo-
quendi. On the contrary, supposing the inscription
to be AEolic, it will be liable to no such objection ;
the power of the words will be τω απτ-ω λιθω ημι.
The T, which l have prefixed to the 0, is absolutely
necessary; for awa-os destitute· of the article never
means the same. Now my hand is in, Ι shall add
another conjecture about the genuine form of this in-
scription, which I am perswaded has been still further
corrupted. The reading, which now prevaiIS, is no
verse3 and the language, when considered as prose,
is vitious. The nature of prose· requires the article
along With ανδριας, as well as with σφελας, ὁ ανδριας,
or rather d τε ανδριας· και το σφελας. And now we
have no sooner rectified the lang-uage, but what con-

, firms the emendation instead of prose· there turns

out acomplete Iambic verse 1, to be thus pronounced,

1. “ I’ll try my hand at it, and
shall keep exactly to the letters ;
only -beg leave to suppose a
Tau, which in above 2000 years
may have been worn out at the
beginning. Ι read, Τοῦ αὐτοῦ
λίθου εἷμίὶνδριᾶς· καὶ τὸ σφέλας.
Ex eodem lapide sum statua et
basis. That is, to the then
pronunciation, and in the now
orthography, Ταῦτοῧ λίθου εἶμ’
ἀνδριάς καὶ τὸ σφέλας. Which
is a true Iambic verse, and
that establishes the correc-
tion. This indeed was worth

telling ; to be both of the same
stone, in a Coloss, was both
costly and extraordinary.''
