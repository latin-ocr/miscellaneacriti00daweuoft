24* APPENDIX.

Bravery, the character which this Hero gives AEneas
in the llth Book, (281) might redound to his
honour in the highest degree:

Munera, quae patriis ad me portastis ab oris,
Vertite ad AEnean3 stetimus tela aspera contra
Contulimusque manus: experto credite quantus

In clypeum assurgat, quo turbine torqueat hastam.
Si duo praeterea tales Idaea tulisset

Terra viros, ultro Inachias venissit ad urbes
Dardanus, et versis lugeret Graecia fatis.

With the same view we find Diomedes'ennobled with
the same Epithet in the AEneis which is given to·
Achilles in the eclogue above mentioned (viii, 9.:)

· Mittitur et magni Venulus Diomedis ad urbem—

Had the same character of AEneas proceeded from an
insignificant, worthless Creature‚ nothing couldhn ᾖς’-ι ᾔ·
rendered the hero more ridiculous. The on ᾗ
wheleby such animals can contribute to flii}¹

praise of any person is to depreciate hirn'. ’
