power not of the Greek but of the Latin E; and
that the third power, which he mentions, is what
obtained, when E in Latin words answered to EI in
the Greek ones, from which they were formed, as in
Homere‘as, Diomedeas, &c. in Greek Ὀμήρειος, Διο-
μήδειος, &c. I should write the 'passage thus: Nostri
Latini cum literis uterentur, quas a Graecis accepe-·
rant, A, Β, etc. (et Graeci vocales habebant totidem
quot et nos A, Ε, etc. nam H et Ω postea sunt ab
his repertae,) Ε et O ternas habebant apud eos [La-
tinos] potestates, ut E esset breve et productum,
I autem longum quodammodo sonaret cum ex [Grae- ,
cis] E et Ι ductum esset. To suppose Victorinus
here treating upon the Greek E makes him incon-

tells us expressly, that amongst the Greeks Ο was
indeed allowed a triple power, but· that E had only
a double one: Apud Graecos autem—E—duarum
obtinet vicem brevis et productae; Ο vero et pro
brevi, et pro longa, et pro U posita est. He tells us
much tshe same· thing in another passage, which
you yourself have quoted, pag. 7. of your Commen-
· tary: Significaveram, priusquam Graecis inter voca-
les repertae sunt H et Ω, vicem earum tam apud
illos quam apud nos explesse E et O; Ο etjam
scribi solitam pro ΟΥ. Surely he would have added
uti et E pro EI, or something tantamount, if he had
before intended to suggest any such thing. His
silence in this respect has the force of a negation3
dum tacet, clamat. 'Elius we find, that Victorinus,
instead of confirming your hypothesis, declares clearly
against it.

The 'second authority, which you produce, is that ⁴
